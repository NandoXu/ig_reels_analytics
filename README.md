<!-- Chosen Palette: Soft Neutrals & Subtle Blues (Background: Neutral-50, Text: Gray-800, Accents: Blue-200, Blue-800, Blue-400) -->
<!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured thematically to guide the user through understanding the Instagram Reels Analytics App. It begins with a clear introduction, followed by a detailed features section. A prominent 'How to Run' section uses a tabbed interface (Windows Executable, macOS, Windows Source, Linux) to provide platform-specific setup instructions, catering to different user technical levels and environments, enhancing usability. This is followed by a practical 'Usage Guide', 'Limitations', and a 'Project Structure' overview for developers. This sequential flow mimics a user's typical journey from discovery to setup and operation, prioritizing intuitive consumption over mirroring the original README's flat structure. -->
<!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
- Introduction/Features/Limitations/Usage/Project Structure: Static text blocks in well-formatted HTML paragraphs and lists, to convey information directly. Justification: These sections are descriptive and textual, best consumed via direct reading.
- Technologies Used: Bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) to visually represent the prominence/importance of the core technologies. Interaction: Passive viewing. Justification: Provides a quick visual summary of the technology stack, making abstract information more engaging.
- How to Run: Tabbed interface (HTML + JavaScript for switching) for Windows Executable, macOS Source, Windows Source, and Linux Source. Interaction: Clicking tabs reveals relevant content. Justification: Crucial for user onboarding, allows users to quickly find platform-specific setup instructions without sifting through irrelevant content, improving user experience significantly.
- All icons/visuals: Unicode characters or simple HTML/CSS shapes. Justification: Adheres to the "NO SVG" and "NO Raster Images" constraints while providing visual cues.
- Responsive Layout: Tailwind CSS flexbox and grid for fluid layouts across devices sizes. Justification: Ensures usability and aesthetic appeal on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    To get the Instagram Reels Analytics App up and running, you have a few options depending on your operating system and preferred setup method. Choose the instructions below that best suit your environment.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Important Note on ChromeDriver:</strong> For Selenium to function, you MUST download the correct ChromeDriver version that matches your installed Google Chrome browser. Find the right version <a href="[https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)" target="_blank">here</a> and place the `chromedriver.exe` (Windows) or `chromedriver` (macOS/Linux) executable into the `chromedriver-win64` or `chromedriver-mac` folder respectively, located within your project directory.

                <h2>Limitations: What to Keep in Mind</h2>
                <p>
                    While powerful, the Instagram Reels Analytics App has certain limitations inherent to web scraping and platform policies. Understanding these will help you use the tool effectively.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anonymous Scraping:</strong> Without logging in via Instaloader, certain data (especially for private accounts or due to Instagram's rate limiting) may not be available or may lead to scraping failures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selenium Fallback Performance:</strong> The Selenium-based scraping, used as a fallback for specific metadata, can be slower and is more susceptible to Instagram's anti-bot measures. Ensure your ChromeDriver version precisely matches your installed Chrome browser for optimal performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Invalid Account URLs:</strong> If you provide an invalid or non-existent Instagram account URL, the system may experience significant delays as it attempts to resolve and process the fake URL.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rate Limits:</strong> Frequent or excessive scraping without appropriate delays may trigger Instagram's rate limits, potentially leading to temporary blocks. It is crucial to use the application responsibly and consider implementing cooldowns for large-scale operations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Project Structure: For Developers & Contributors</h2>
                <p>
                    For those interested in contributing or understanding the codebase, here's an overview of the project's directory and file structure.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>ig_reels_analytics.py</code>: The main entry point of the application. It handles GUI initialization, database setup, and the Instaloader login sequence.</li>
                    <li><code>database.py</code>: Manages all interactions with the SQLite database, including creating the table, saving, loading, and deleting scraped Reels data.</li>
                    <li><code>ui/</code>: Contains modules related to the Graphical User Interface (GUI), such as the main `InstagramScraperApp` class and logic for login overlays.</li>
                    <li><code>scraper/</code>: Holds the core scraping logic and configurations. This includes setup for user data directories, Instaloader usage, and fallback methods using Selenium with undetected-chromedriver.</li>
                    <li><code>requirements.txt</code>: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the application.</li>
                    <li><code>instagram_analytics.db</code>: The SQLite database file, which is automatically generated at runtime when the application is first launched.</li>
                </ul>
